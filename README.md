# Xbox DriverConvertor

Project to make xbox disc available on pc.

## How use?

Mount xbox disc and execute command:
`sudo ./Xbox.DriverConvertor toggle`

After making changes, call the command again, otherwise the xbox will not recognize the disk.

## Note

The project has only been tested on MacOS. Not sure if it works under Windows and Linux.
